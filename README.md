# @loconomics/badgr

A simple interface to [Badgr](https://badgr.io) tailored specifically to the needs of [Loconomics](https://loconomics.com).

## Development Setup

Start by [installing the Yarn package manager](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install). NPM will also work, but will not create reproduceable builds. Then run:

```bash
$ yarn
$ yarn watch
```

Build documentation using:
```bash
$ yarn doc
```

then open _docs/index.html_ in your browser.

Run the tests:

```bash
$ yarn test
```

Publish a package with:

```bash
$ yarn publish
```
